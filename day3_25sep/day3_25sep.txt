access data - using function 
access specifiers  -  private , public and protected (not support)
getter and setters
implementation level

2. data abstraction  - data hiding 
    only essestinal info
design level 
abstract class (not support)


3. inheritance  - reusability of code + extensibility of code
parent /super / base  
child /sub / dervied 

single level -> Person<---------------Employee  (class Employee extends Person{})
multilevel  -> Person <----- Employee <---- Developer 
hierarchical  -> Employee <----------- Developer
                         <----------- Tester 
                         <----- SalesExecutive

mother

function overloading - not supported 
function overriding 


static data member
